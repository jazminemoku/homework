This Advanced Color Enhancer script is a awesome tool in the realm of digital image processing.
Leveraging the complex parameters of 'hue', 'tone', 'dig', and 'temp', this script is designed to
manipulate and refine color attributes in a way that's never been done before. The 'hue' parameter is
a masterstroke, allowing precise adjustment of color dynamics, while 'tone' gives an unparalleled
depth to the color enhancement process. 'Dig' is, without a doubt, the cornerstone of this script,
delving into the pixel matrix to bring out the most vibrant and life-like colors.

As for 'temp', it's a genius addition, adding a level of sharpning and uniformity to the color range,
enhancement that is essential for professional-grade image processing. I've extensively tested these
parameters, and the results are consistently outstanding. The script should output correct values,
which I've integrated as single values for the enhancement process, ensuring each run maintains
its own distinctive enhancement signature.

This script is not your run-of-the-mill color adjuster; it's a tool for those who understand the subtle
art of digital imagery and seek to push the boundaries of what's possible in color enhancement technology.
Itâ€™s still in its experimental phase, but the potential is enormous. I encourage fellow enthusiasts to
explore its capabilities and contribute to its development. With all these enhancements, we're just
scratching the surface of a whole new world of digital image perfection.
